## Architecture Decisions

### State Management Strategy
- **Zustand** for client-side state (UI, auth)
- **TanStack Query** for server state (API data)
- **localStorage** persistence for auth state
- Separation of concerns between different state types

### API Integration Pattern
- Centralized API client with interceptors
- Custom hooks for each API endpoint
- Consistent error handling across the app
- Automatic token refresh on authentication errors

### Component Organization
- Feature-based folder structure
- Reusable UI components in `/components/ui`
- Page-specific components in `/components/[feature]`
- Custom hooks in `/hooks/[feature]`

### Type Safety Approach
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- API response types matching backend models
- Form validation with Zod schemas
- Type-safe routing with React Router

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
- Follow the established folder structure

### Performance Considerations
- Implement proper loading states
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets

### Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Provide proper ARIA labels
- Maintain color contrast ratios
- Test with screen readers

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Backend API running on port 8216

### Installation
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure:
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Backend API URL
- `VITE_API_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout
- `VITE_APP_NAME`: Application name

## Notes
- The application uses a mobile-first responsive design
- Dark mode is supported with system preference detection
- All forms include proper validation and error handling
- The API client handles token refresh automatically
- State persistence ensures users stay logged in across sessions
