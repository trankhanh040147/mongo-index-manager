# Mongo Index Manager Frontend: Development Plan & Technical Roadmap

## 1. Project Vision & Goals

### Vision

To create a modern, intuitive, and high-performance web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for the `mongo-index-manager` backend. This frontend will empower database administrators and developers to efficiently manage MongoDB indexes across multiple environments, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors through a clear and interactive visual interface.

### SMART Goals

*   **Reduce Time:** Decrease the time required for common index management tasks (view, create, delete) by 50% for DBAs and developers within the first quarter of deployment.
*   **Improve Accessibility:** Provide a centralized and user-friendly interface for index management, eliminating the need for direct shell access for 90% of routine index operations.
*   **Enhance Performance:** Achieve a Lighthouse performance score of 95+ for the production application to ensure a fast and responsive user experience.
*   **Increase Confidence:** Reduce the rate of accidental index misconfigurations by 75% by providing clear visual feedback, confirmation dialogues, and detailed index information.
*   **Adoption Rate:** Achieve an 80% adoption rate among the target internal engineering teams within two months of the official launch.

- **Custom hooks** - Reusable logic extraction  
- **Type safety** - Comprehensive TypeScript usage
- **Error handling** - Graceful degradation and user feedback

### Performance Considerations
- **Code splitting** - Lazy loading for route components
- **Memoization** - React.memo for expensive components
- **Virtual scrolling** - For large data sets (indexes, collections)
- **Optimistic updates** - Immediate UI feedback

### Testing Strategy (Future)
- **Unit tests** - Vitest for utilities and hooks
- **Component tests** - React Testing Library
- **E2E tests** - Playwright for critical user flows
- **API mocking** - MSW for development and testing

## 8. Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Changes:** Comprehensive TypeScript types provide early detection
- **Performance:** Virtual scrolling and pagination strategies ready
- **Security:** JWT handling follows best practices

### Development Risks  
- **Scope Creep:** Phased approach with clear milestones
- **Backend Dependencies:** API client abstraction allows for mocking
