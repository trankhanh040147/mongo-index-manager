# Mongo Index Manager Frontend: Development Plan & Technical Roadmap

## 1. Project Vision & Goals

### Vision

To create a modern, intuitive, and high-performance web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for the `mongo-index-manager` backend. This frontend will empower database administrators and developers to efficiently manage MongoDB indexes across multiple environments, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors through a clear and interactive visual interface.

### SMART Goals

*   **Reduce Time:** Decrease the time required for common index management tasks (view, create, delete) by 50% for DBAs and developers within the first quarter of deployment.
*   **Improve Accessibility:** Provide a centralized and user-friendly interface for index management, eliminating the need for direct shell access for 90% of routine index operations.
*   **Enhance Performance:** Achieve a Lighthouse performance score of 95+ for the production application to ensure a fast and responsive user experience.
*   **Increase Confidence:** Reduce the rate of accidental index misconfigurations by 75% by providing clear visual feedback, confirmation dialogues, and detailed index information.
*   **Adoption Rate:** Achieve an 80% adoption rate among the target internal engineering teams within two months of the official launch.

## 2. Technical Stack Proposal

### Framework: React with Vite

*   **Recommendation:** **React (with Vite)**
*   **Justification:** React's component-based architecture is ideal for building a complex, stateful application like a database management tool. Vite provides an extremely fast development server and optimized build process, significantly improving developer experience and productivity. Its mature ecosystem ensures access to a vast array of libraries and tools.

### UI Component Library: Shadcn/ui

*   **Recommendation:** **Shadcn/ui**
*   **Justification:** Shadcn/ui is not a traditional component library but a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and reusable components built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. This approach provides maximum flexibility and ownership over the code. Its aesthetic is perfect for data-dense, professional applications, offering components like tables, forms, and dialogs that are essential for this project.

### State Management: Zustand

*   **Recommendation:** **Zustand**
*   **Justification:** Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management solution. Its simple, hook-based API makes it easy to manage both simple and complex state without the boilerplate often associated with Redux. It's powerful enough to handle application-wide state (like connection details and user auth) while remaining lightweight and performant.

### Styling: Tailwind CSS

*   **Recommendation:** **Tailwind CSS**
*   **Justification:** As a utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind CSS allows for rapid UI development directly within the markup. It enforces design consistency and pairs perfectly with Shadcn/ui. This strategy eliminates the need for separate CSS files, streamlines the styling process, and makes maintaining a consistent design system straightforward.

### Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Testing:** **Vitest** - A fast and modern testing framework that is fully compatible with Vite. It will be used to test individual functions, hooks, and utilities in isolation.
*   **Component Testing:** **React Testing Library** - To test React components from a user's perspective, ensuring they are rendered correctly and are interactive.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** **Playwright** - For comprehensive E2E tests that simulate real user workflows, such as logging in, connecting to a database, and creating an index. Playwright offers robust cross-browser testing capabilities.

## 3. Core Features (Epics)

*   **Epic 1: User Authentication & Connection Management**
    *   User registration and login interface.
    *   Secure storage of JWT tokens.
    *   CRUD operations for saving, viewing, updating, and deleting MongoDB connection strings.
    *   Form validation and secure handling of sensitive credentials.

    *   Real-time fetching of database and collection lists.
    *   Search/filter functionality to quickly locate specific databases or collections.
    *   Display of basic metadata for each database and collection (e.g., size, document count).

    *   Display a detailed list of all indexes for a selected collection in a data table.
    *   Provide a detailed view for each index, showing its fields, type, size, and other properties.
    *   A user-friendly form/wizard for creating new indexes with support for various types (single-field, compound, text, etc.).
    *   A secure mechanism to delete indexes, including a confirmation modal to prevent accidental deletion.

*   **Epic 4: User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)**
    *   A central dashboard providing an overview of connections and system status.
    *   A global notification system for success, error, and warning messages.
    *   Consistent and robust error handling for API failures and user input errors.
    *   Loading states (skeletons, spinners) to provide feedback during data fetching operations.
    *   A responsive design that works seamlessly on various screen sizes.

## 4. Assumed Backend API Contract

The frontend will consume the RESTful API provided by the `mongo-index-manager` backend. Based on the `API_REFERENCE.md`, the primary endpoints are:

*   **Authentication**
    *   `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - Create a new user.
    *   `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - Authenticate and receive JWT.

*   **Connection Management (Assumed - to be built in backend)**
    *   `POST /api/v1/connections` - Save a new MongoDB connection string.
    *   `GET /api/v1/connections` - Retrieve all saved connections for the user.
    *   `PUT /api/v1/connections/{connId}` - Update a connection.
    *   `DELETE /api/v1/connections/{connId}` - Delete a connection.

*   **Database & Collection Exploration (Assumed)**
    *   `GET /api/v1/connections/{connId}/databases` - List all databases for a given connection.
    *   `GET /api/v1/databases/{dbName}/collections` - List all collections in a specific database.

*   **Index Management (Assumed)**
    *   `GET /api/v1/collections/{collName}/indexes` - List all indexes for a collection.
    *   `POST /api/v1/collections/{collName}/indexes` - Create a new index.
        *   *Sample Request Body:*
            ```json
            {
              "name": "user_email_unique",
              "keys": { "email": 1 },
              "options": {
                "unique": true
              }
            }
            ```
    *   `DELETE /api/v1/indexes/{indexName}` - Delete an index.

## 7. Assumptions, Dependencies, and Risks

### Assumptions

*   The backend API is stable, documented (`API_REFERENCE.md`), and deployed to a staging environment accessible by the frontend.
*   The API contract defined in section 4 is accurate or will be implemented as specified.
*   The backend handles all logic for interacting with MongoDB; the frontend is purely a presentation and interaction layer.

### Dependencies

*   **Backend Team:** Availability of the backend team for API clarifications, bug fixing, and potential feature requests (e.g., new endpoints for connection management).
*   **Staging Environment:** A stable staging environment for both frontend and backend is required for development and testing.
*   **Design Assets:** Access to any official branding guidelines or logos if required.

### Risks & Mitigation Strategies

*   **Risk 1: Performance issues when rendering large numbers of databases, collections, or indexes.**
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement virtualization/windowing for long lists and data tables (e.g., using `TanStack Virtual`) to ensure the DOM remains lightweight and responsive.
*   **Risk 2: Backend API is not yet fully implemented or contains bugs.**
    *   **Mitigation:** Start development using a mocked API service (e.g., using MSW - Mock Service Worker) to allow parallel development. Maintain open communication channels with the backend team.
*   **Risk 3: Security vulnerabilities related to handling credentials.**
    *   **Mitigation:** Ensure all sensitive data is transmitted over HTTPS. Store JWTs securely in `httpOnly` cookies if possible, or in memory. Never store raw connection strings in local storage. Conduct a security review before deployment.
*   **Risk 4: Scope Creep.**
    *   **Mitigation:** Adhere strictly to the phased rollout plan. All new feature requests must be evaluated, prioritized, and added to the backlog for future phases, protecting the current milestone's timeline.
